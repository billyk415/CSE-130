# Requirements

U need a ubuntu environment with clang installed on it to run the code properly.

# Limitations and Issues

The program will only run correctly in unix environment as program using some system calls available in unix only.
You should not run the program on a port already reserved by Unix for some other utility.
This program does not support hostname facility for user and *IP address* that user provides should be valid.
